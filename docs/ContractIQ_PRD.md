## 1. Problem

### What problem is this solving?

Business professionals — founders, operations managers, and procurement leads — routinely sign NDAs and MSAs without fully understanding what they are agreeing to. Without in-house legal teams, reviewing a single contract takes an average of 90–120 minutes, requires legal expertise most SMBs don't have, and frequently results in missed obligations, unfavourable terms, or costly disputes. Existing tools either require legal training or produce generic summaries that don't surface the specific clauses that matter most to each business.

ContractIQ solves this by automatically extracting the key terms from any NDA or MSA, telling the user exactly where each term lives in the document, how confident the extraction is, and allowing them to ask follow-up questions about the contract in plain English — all without needing a lawyer on call.

### Why is this problem worth solving?

**Quantified pain:**

- The global legal tech market was valued at $25.9B in 2023 and is growing at 9.1% CAGR (Grand View Research, 2023 — assumed).
- SMBs spend an average of $1,500–$3,000 for a single lawyer-reviewed contract (assumption based on US market legal billing rates of $250–$500/hr).
- 43% of SMBs report having experienced a commercial dispute stemming from contract misunderstanding (Law Society of England & Wales, 2023 — assumed).
- The Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) software market alone is projected to reach $4.1B by 2027 (assumed, Markets and Markets).

**Market gap:**

Existing tools (DocuSign CLM, Ironclad, Kira Systems) are designed for enterprise legal teams with $50k–$500k annual contracts. ChatGPT and generic AI assistants lack structured extraction, page-level attribution, confidence scoring, and contract-type-specific term libraries. There is no affordable, focused tool purpose-built for SMBs reviewing NDA and MSA contracts with a streamlined upload-extract-chat workflow.

**MOAT:**

ContractIQ's defensibility comes from four sources:
1. **Contract-type specificity:** The prompt library and key-term schema are purpose-built for NDA and MSA structures. Generic LLMs extract "something" from contracts; ContractIQ extracts the 20–30 terms that actually matter for each contract type with page-level attribution.
2. **Feedback-driven improvement:** Every user correction to an extracted term is logged (opt-in, anonymised) and used to improve prompt quality over time — creating a proprietary improvement loop.
3. **Confidence scoring with transparency:** Showing a confidence score per extracted term teaches users what to scrutinise, building trust and reducing the "black box" problem that keeps lawyers in the loop.
4. **Chat-grounded-in-document:** The Q&A feature strictly answers from the uploaded contract text, not from general knowledge — reducing hallucination risk that undermines trust in generic AI chat tools.

### Why Agentic AI?

| Dimension | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What unstructured data is involved?** | Free-form legal prose across NDAs and MSAs with no standardised structure. A "Governing Law" clause may appear in one contract as a numbered section on page 2 and in another as an inline sentence buried in Section 11.4 |
| **Why rule-based systems fail** | Regex and keyword matching cannot handle clause variant diversity. A confidentiality obligation may be phrased in 50+ structurally different ways across different law firms and geographies. Rule-based parsers produce >30% miss rate on real-world contracts |
| **Why LLMs are necessary** | GPT-4o can read legal prose in context, reason about what a clause means, identify the value of a term (e.g. "36 months" as the notice period), and attribute it to a page number — all in a single inference pass |
| **Why not just ChatGPT?** | ChatGPT gives unstructured summaries with no page reference, no confidence score, no schema, and no ability to add custom terms to the extraction schema. ContractIQ wraps OpenAI in a structured workflow that produces machine-readable, auditable, user-correctable output |

## 2. User

### Who are you solving this problem for?

**Primary persona — The Time-Pressed Founder / Ops Lead**

- **Industry:** SaaS, agency, professional services, fintech, e-commerce
- **Role:** Founder, COO, Procurement Manager, Legal Operations Manager
- **Company size:** 5–250 employees; no in-house legal counsel
- **Behaviour:** Signs 5–15 NDAs or MSAs per month; relies on Google searches or expensive ad-hoc legal consultations to understand contract terms
- **Pain:** Spends 90–120 minutes per contract review; frequently misses key obligations (auto-renewal clauses, indemnification limits, IP assignment); pays $250–$500/hr for a lawyer to review something that feels routine

**Secondary persona — The Freelancer / Consultant**

- **Industry:** Design, marketing, software development, consulting
- **Role:** Individual contributor signing client contracts
- **Behaviour:** Receives 1–4 MSAs per month from larger clients; often signs without reading carefully because the power imbalance discourages pushback
- **Pain:** Cannot afford legal review; unsure which clauses are non-standard or risky; no tool gives page-level references with confidence scores

## 3. Core Metrics, Prioritisation & Roadmap

### How will you know the problem is solved? (Core Metrics)

**North Star Metric:** Average time from contract upload to completed key-term review
- **Baseline:** 90 minutes (manual review, no tool)
- **Target:** ≤ 15 minutes end-to-end within ContractIQ
- **Tracked via:** Session logs (upload timestamp → user marks review complete or last interaction timestamp)

**Primary Metrics:**

| Metric | Baseline | Target | How tracked |
|---|---|---|---|
| Key-term extraction accuracy (F1) | 0% (no tool baseline) | ≥ 88% F1 on NDA/MSA test set | Offline eval suite against ground-truth labelled contracts |
| Confidence score calibration | — | Predicted confidence within ±10% of actual accuracy | Calibration curve computed on eval set |
| Time to first extracted key-term display | — | ≤ 30 seconds P95 for contracts ≤ 20 pages | Server-side timing logs |

**Secondary Metrics:**

| Metric | Baseline | Target | How tracked |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30-day user retention | — | ≥ 45% | Supabase session analytics |
| NPS (Net Promoter Score) | — | ≥ 40 | In-app feedback survey at session end |
| Contracts processed per active user per month | — | ≥ 4 | Dashboard analytics query on contracts table |
| AI extraction correction rate | — | ≤ 12% of terms manually corrected by users | corrections_count / total_extracted_terms per session |
| Cost per contract analysis (OpenAI tokens) | — | ≤ $0.25 per analysis (20-page contract) | Billing logs from OpenAI usage dashboard |

### Prioritisation

#### Breaking the Agentic Workflow into Components

1. **Component A — User Authentication & Session Management** (Supabase Auth)
2. **Component B — PDF Upload & Text Extraction** (Supabase Storage + pdf-parse)
3. **Component C — Key Term Extraction via OpenAI** (GPT-4o structured output)
4. **Component D — Custom Term Addition** (user input → appended to extraction prompt)
5. **Component E — Results Display (PDF Viewer + Key Terms Panel)** (PDF.js + React)
6. **Component F — Contract Chat (Q&A)** (GPT-4o RAG-style with full contract context)
7. **Component G — Dashboard & History** (Supabase queries on contracts + key_terms tables)
8. **Component H — Feedback Collection** (Supabase write to user_feedback table)

#### Risk Assessment per Component

| Component | Check | Result | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| B — PDF Text Extraction | Is ML necessary? | FAIL | Rule-based PDF parsing (pdf-parse) is sufficient for text-layer PDFs; ML (OCR) only needed for scanned PDFs, which are out of scope |
| B — PDF Text Extraction | Do we have data? | PASS | pdf-parse handles standard PDF text layers without training data |
| B — PDF Text Extraction | Can it meet accuracy requirements? | PARTIAL | ≥ 95% text fidelity for text-layer PDFs; scanned PDFs will fail gracefully |
| B — PDF Text Extraction | What about bias? | PASS | Pure text extraction; no model bias risk |
| B — PDF Text Extraction | **Architecture note** | — | Text is extracted **once at upload**, stored in `contracts.contract_text` with `[PAGE N]` markers. The processing pipeline and chat route both read from the DB — neither downloads the PDF again. Supabase Storage is used only for the inline PDF viewer (non-blocking: if Storage is unavailable, only the viewer is hidden; the AI pipeline is unaffected) |
| C — Key Term Extraction | Is ML necessary? | PASS | Clause variant diversity across law firms and geographies makes rule-based extraction untenable |
| C — Key Term Extraction | Do we have data to train? | PARTIAL | No proprietary labelled dataset at launch; relying on CUAD dataset + few-shot prompting. Fine-tuning planned for v2 |
| C — Key Term Extraction | Can it be solved by AI? | PASS | GPT-4o demonstrated strong NDA/MSA extraction in internal testing (assumed) |
| C — Key Term Extraction | Can it meet accuracy requirements? | PARTIAL | Targeting ≥ 88% F1; current zero-shot is ~76% F1 (assumed baseline); few-shot prompt expected to close the gap |
| C — Key Term Extraction | Can it scale? | PASS | OpenAI API scales horizontally; rate limits manageable at projected early usage |
| C — Key Term Extraction | How fast can we get feedback? | PASS | User corrections are logged immediately; weekly review cycle planned |
| C — Key Term Extraction | What are the laws? | PARTIAL | GDPR compliance required; no PII used in prompts beyond the contract itself; legal review of data processing needed before EU launch |
| C — Key Term Extraction | What about bias? | PARTIAL | Model may perform worse on non-US/non-UK contract conventions; in-scope for MVP is English-language contracts only |
| C — Key Term Extraction | How transparent/explainable? | PASS | Source sentence shown per term; confidence score shown; user can view the raw text |
| C — Key Term Extraction | How easy to judge good vs bad? | PASS | Ground truth is the contract text itself; user corrections provide direct signal |
| F — Contract Chat | Is ML necessary? | PASS | Natural language Q&A over unstructured legal text requires LLM understanding |
| F — Contract Chat | Can it meet accuracy requirements? | PARTIAL | Grounding via full contract context reduces hallucination; risk remains for ambiguous or multi-part clauses |
| F — Contract Chat | What about bias? | PARTIAL | Model may be overconfident on unfamiliar contract types; confidence is not surfaced in chat (only in extraction) — mitigation: add "Based on the document…" prefix to all responses |
| F — Contract Chat | How transparent/explainable? | PASS | Mandatory page citation on every response; system prompt forbids using general knowledge |

#### Overall Risk Summary

| Component | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| B — PDF Text Extraction | Low | Reject scanned PDFs gracefully with clear user message; support text-layer PDFs only at MVP |
| C — Key Term Extraction | Medium | Few-shot prompting + offline eval suite + user correction feedback loop; confidence scoring gives user control |
| D — Custom Term Addition | Low | User-defined terms are injected into a well-tested prompt schema; limited to 5 terms at MVP to manage context length |
| E — Results Display | Low | PDF.js is a mature, battle-tested library; lazy page loading mitigates large file rendering issues |
| F — Contract Chat | Medium-High | System prompt strictly limits responses to document text; page citation enforced; "I cannot find this in the document" fallback added |
| G — Dashboard & History | Low | Simple Supabase queries with indexed user_id; no AI involvement |
| H — Feedback Collection | Low | Simple form-to-database write; no AI involvement |

**Dependencies:**

- OpenAI API access and approved usage terms (required before v0.2 ships)
- Supabase project provisioned with Pro plan for production (required before v1.0)
- Legal review of terms of service and data processing agreement (required before v1.0 public launch)
- GDPR DPA with OpenAI confirmed before EU user onboarding

**External Dependencies:**

| Dependency | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI API availability | OpenAI outages directly block contract processing | Implement retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts); surface human-readable error to user with "Try again in a few minutes" CTA |
| OpenAI pricing changes | Token cost increases could push per-analysis cost above $0.25 threshold | Monitor usage monthly; maintain cost alerting at 80% of budget threshold; evaluate Claude or Gemini as fallback if cost doubles |
| Supabase free tier limits | 500 MB DB + 1 GB storage on free tier; will breach at ~200 contracts | Migrate to Supabase Pro ($25/month) before beta launch; alert at 70% storage usage |
| PDF.js rendering compatibility | Complex PDFs with unusual fonts or layouts may not render correctly | Test against 50 real-world NDAs and MSAs during beta; provide a "download PDF" fallback link if rendering fails |
| Browser file API limits | Large PDFs (near 10 MB) may cause browser memory issues on low-end devices | Enforce 10 MB server-side limit; recommend Chrome/Firefox on desktop; warn mobile users |

**Internal Risks:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI extraction accuracy below 88% F1 target | Medium | High | Few-shot prompt tuning + offline eval suite; lower launch threshold to 82% F1 with transparency to users (confidence scores visible) |
| Users uploading non-NDA/MSA contracts | High | Low | Soft warning if contract type detection doesn't match user's selection; graceful degradation (still extracts, just may miss domain-specific terms) |
| Chat hallucination (AI answers from general knowledge, not document) | Medium | High | System prompt enforces document-only answers; automated test: feed a question about a topic not in the document, expect "I cannot find this" response |
| Supabase RLS misconfiguration exposing user data | Low | Critical | Pre-launch security review: attempt cross-user data access from test accounts; RLS unit tests in CI pipeline |

## 4. MVP Features

### User Flows

#### Flow 1 — New Visitor → Sign Up → Dashboard

```
Landing Page → Click "Sign Up" → Supabase Auth (Email/Password) 
→ Email Verification → Redirect to Dashboard
```

1. User lands on the ContractIQ marketing page; sees product value prop, a short demo GIF, and two CTAs: "Sign In" and "Get Started Free"
2. Clicking "Get Started Free" opens the Supabase Auth sign-up modal (email + password)
3. On successful registration, user is redirected to the Dashboard
4. Dashboard greets user with an empty state: "No contracts reviewed yet — upload your first contract to begin"

#### Flow 2 — Returning User → Dashboard

```
Sign In → Supabase Auth → Dashboard
```

1. User sees a summary card: total contracts processed, contracts by type (NDA / MSA), last 5 contracts reviewed with status and date
2. Quick-action button: "Review a Contract" is prominently placed

#### Flow 3 — Core Flow: Contract Review

```
Click "Review Contract" → Choose Contract Type (NDA / MSA) → Upload PDF 
→ PDF Text Extraction → Key Term Preview → Add Custom Terms (optional) 
→ Click "Process Contract" → OpenAI Extraction → Results Page 
→ Contract Preview + Key Term Panel + Chat
```

Detailed steps:

1. **Upload screen:** User selects contract type (NDA or MSA) from a dropdown, then drags and drops or file-picks a PDF (max 20 pages / 10 MB for MVP)
2. **Pre-processing preview:** While the PDF text is being extracted, the UI shows a preview card listing the standard key terms ContractIQ will look for based on the selected contract type. For NDAs this includes: Parties, Effective Date, Confidentiality Obligations, Permitted Disclosures, Term & Duration, Governing Law, Jurisdiction, IP Ownership, Non-Solicitation, Breach & Remedy. For MSAs: Parties, Service Scope, Payment Terms, Invoice Schedule, Late Payment Penalty, Liability Cap, Indemnification, IP Ownership, Termination Clause, Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, Notice Period
3. **Custom term addition:** A clearly visible "+ Add Key Term" button allows the user to type a custom term they want extracted (e.g. "Non-compete radius") before processing begins. Added terms appear in the preview list with a "Custom" badge
4. **Process trigger:** User clicks "Process Contract" — a progress indicator appears (step 1: extracting text, step 2: analysing with AI, step 3: compiling results)
5. **Results page:** Displayed in a two-panel layout:
   - **Left panel:** Interactive PDF viewer (scrollable, zoomable) with page numbers and highlighted spans for extracted terms
   - **Right panel:** Key terms list, each showing Term Name | Extracted Value | Page Number | Confidence Score (colour-coded: green ≥ 80%, amber 50–79%, red < 50%)
6. **Manual correction:** User can click any extracted term to edit its value inline — correction is saved to Supabase and flagged for feedback loop
7. **Chat button:** A floating "Chat with Contract" button (or sidebar tab) opens the chat interface within the same view. All chat messages are saved to Supabase and linked to the contract session
8. **Hallucination safeguard:** If confidence score < 50%, the term value is shown with a ⚠️ flag and a tooltip: "Low confidence — we recommend verifying this in the document directly." The PDF viewer auto-highlights the nearest matching page span
9. **Explainability:** Each extracted term has an expandable "Why?" section showing the verbatim sentence from the contract that the AI used to extract the value

#### Flow 4 — Chat with Contract

```
Results Page → Click "Chat" Tab → Type Question → OpenAI Response (grounded in contract text) 
→ Conversation logged to Supabase
```

1. User types a question such as "What happens if I breach the NDA?" or "Is there an auto-renewal clause?"
2. The backend passes the full extracted contract text + conversation history to OpenAI with a system prompt instructing it to answer only from the provided document text
3. The response appears in a chat UI (user messages right-aligned, AI responses left-aligned)
4. Each AI response includes a "Source: Page X" citation linking to the relevant page in the PDF viewer
5. Conversation is saved in `chat_messages` table, linked to `chat_sessions`, linked to the contract

### Functional Requirements

**User Stories:**

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| US-001 | As a founder, I want to sign up with my email and password so that my contracts and chat history are saved privately | Auth flow completes within 10 seconds; user is redirected to Dashboard on success; invalid credentials return a clear error message | P0 |
| US-002 | As a user, I want to upload a PDF contract and see the key terms extracted automatically so that I don't have to read the whole document line by line | PDF upload accepts files up to 10 MB; extraction completes within 30 seconds P95 for ≤ 20 pages; key terms panel shows ≥ 80% of standard NDA/MSA terms with values | P0 |
| US-003 | As a user, I want to see which page each key term was found on so that I can verify the extraction myself | Each extracted term displays a page number; clicking the page number scrolls the PDF viewer to that page | P0 |
| US-004 | As a user, I want to see a confidence score for each extracted term so that I know which terms I should verify manually | Each term shows a confidence score (0–100%); scores < 50% show a warning icon and tooltip | P0 |
| US-005 | As a user, I want to add a custom key term before processing so that I can get values for clauses specific to my situation | Custom terms appear in the pre-processing preview; processed results include custom term extraction with the same structure (value, page, confidence) | P0 |
| US-006 | As a user, I want to see a preview of the PDF within the app so that I don't have to switch between windows while reviewing | PDF viewer renders all pages; user can scroll, zoom in/out; highlighted term references are clickable | P1 |
| US-007 | As a user, I want to chat with my contract in plain English so that I can ask specific questions without searching manually | Chat responds within 15 seconds; responses are grounded in the uploaded document text; each response cites a page number | P1 |
| US-008 | As a user, I want my dashboard to show all the contracts I've reviewed so that I have a record of my review history | Dashboard displays contract name, type, date uploaded, and review status; clicking any row opens the results page for that contract | P1 |
| US-009 | As a user, I want to edit an incorrectly extracted term so that the record is accurate | Inline edit saves to Supabase within 2 seconds; edited terms display an "Edited" badge; original AI value is stored separately for feedback purposes | P1 |
| US-010 | As a user, I want to submit feedback on the AI's accuracy so that the product improves over time | A thumbs up / thumbs down rating and optional text comment is available on the results page; feedback is saved to `user_feedback` table | P2 |
| US-011 | As a user, I want to export the key terms as a CSV or PDF report so that I can share the review summary with my team | Export button generates a formatted file within 5 seconds and downloads to the browser | P2 |
| US-012 | As a user, I want the chat history for each contract to persist so that I can revisit my questions later | Chat messages are stored in Supabase; reopening a contract's results page loads the previous chat session | P1 |

**Functional Requirements Table:**

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | Users must be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out using Supabase Auth (email/password) | P0 | Auth state persists via Supabase session tokens stored in browser |
| FR-02 | The system must accept PDF uploads up to 10 MB and 20 pages; reject files outside these limits with a clear error | P0 | Only NDA and MSA documents in scope for MVP |
| FR-03 | The system must extract text from the uploaded PDF at upload time, store it in `contracts.contract_text`, and reuse it for AI extraction and chat — without re-downloading the PDF | P0 | Text extraction (with `[PAGE N]` markers) happens server-side during upload; the extracted text is stored in the DB so that the processing and chat pipelines never depend on Supabase Storage being available |
| FR-04 | The key terms panel must display: Term Name, Extracted Value, Page Number, Confidence Score (%) for each term | P0 | Page numbers are 1-indexed; confidence score is returned from prompt and validated |
| FR-05 | Users must be able to add at least 5 custom key terms before processing; these must appear in results with the same data structure as standard terms | P0 | Custom terms stored in `custom_key_terms` table with `is_manual = true` flag |
| FR-06 | The results page must always display contract content — either as an interactive PDF viewer (when Storage is available) or as a paginated text viewer fallback (when Storage is unavailable) | P1 | Primary: PDF.js viewer using a 1-hour signed URL from Supabase Storage. Fallback: text viewer that parses `[PAGE N]` markers from `contracts.contract_text`, renders each page as a labelled section, and supports the same page-navigation behavior as the PDF viewer. Both viewers must respond to `targetPage` prop changes from key-term click events |
| FR-07 | Clicking a page reference on the key terms panel must scroll the PDF viewer to the corresponding page | P1 | Smooth scroll with visual highlight on referenced paragraph |
| FR-08 | The chat interface must send the user's question + full contract text to OpenAI and display the grounded response | P1 | System prompt enforces document-only answers; responses include page citation |
| FR-09 | All chat messages must be saved to Supabase in real-time with role (user / assistant) and timestamp | P1 | Linked to chat_sessions → contracts → users |
| FR-10 | The Dashboard must show: total contracts reviewed, breakdown by type (NDA / MSA), a sortable list of all previous contracts | P1 | Sortable by date, name, type; clickable rows open results |
| FR-11 | Terms with confidence < 50% must show a visual warning and recommend manual verification | P0 | ⚠️ icon + tooltip; do NOT hide the term — show it with the warning |
| FR-12 | The user must be able to submit a thumbs-up / thumbs-down feedback per contract review with an optional text comment | P2 | Stored in `user_feedback` table with user_id, contract_id, rating, comment, timestamp |
| FR-13 | The system must store all contracts, key terms, sessions, messages, and feedback in a single Supabase project with row-level security | P0 | Each table has a `user_id` foreign key; RLS policies ensure users only see their own data |
| FR-14 | The complete database setup — all tables, indexes, triggers, RLS policies, the Supabase Storage bucket, and Storage RLS policies — must be expressible as a single paste-and-run SQL file | P0 | Use `INSERT INTO storage.buckets` to create the bucket and `CREATE POLICY ON storage.objects` for Storage RLS; file path pattern is `contracts/{user_id}/{contract_id}/{filename}.pdf`; Storage policies must restrict INSERT/SELECT/DELETE to `auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]` |

### Agent Capabilities & System Behaviour

| Component | Input | Output | Autonomy Level | Human-in-Loop Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PDF Text Extractor | Uploaded PDF file (binary) | Raw text string with `[PAGE N]` markers stored in `contracts.contract_text` | Fully autonomous | If extracted text < 100 words (likely scanned/image PDF), show error: "Scanned PDFs are not supported yet"; extraction happens once at upload — all downstream features (processing, chat) read from the stored text, not the file |
| Key Term Extractor | Contract text + contract type + custom term list | JSON: `[{ term_name, value, page_number, confidence_score, source_sentence }]` | Autonomous + review | If confidence < 50% on any term, flag with ⚠️ and recommend manual check |
| Confidence Evaluator | Extracted term + source sentence | Confidence score 0–100 | Autonomous | Always shown to user; no threshold blocks display |
| Contract Chat Agent | User question + full contract text + conversation history | Plain-English answer with page citation | Suggests, human decides | Always: AI cannot take actions on the contract; it only answers questions |
| Feedback Logger | User rating + optional comment + contract_id | Stored feedback record | Fully autonomous | — |

## 5. Constraints

**Performance constraints:**

- P95 end-to-end extraction latency (upload → results displayed) ≤ 30 seconds for contracts up to 20 pages.
- Time to first extracted key-term display ≤ 30 seconds P95 for contracts ≤ 20 pages.
- Chat response latency ≤ 15 seconds P95.
- Each OpenAI call ≤ 20 seconds P95.
- Inline edit saves to Supabase within 2 seconds; export file generation within 5 seconds.
- Auth flow completes within 10 seconds.

**Upload & document constraints:**

- PDF uploads limited to **10 MB** and **20 pages**; files outside these limits are rejected with a clear error.
- Contract length ≤ 15,000 tokens for MVP; longer contracts rejected with a clear message.
- Only **text-layer PDFs** supported; scanned/image PDFs fail gracefully ("Scanned PDFs are not supported yet"). Trigger: extracted text < 100 words.
- Only **NDA and MSA** English-language contracts (US/UK law) in scope for MVP.
- Maximum **5 custom key terms** per analysis at MVP to manage context length.

**Cost constraints:**

- Cost per contract analysis ≤ $0.25 per 20-page contract (extraction target ≤ $0.20).

**Scalability constraints:**

- Must handle 100 concurrent contract analyses without degradation during beta.
- Architecture must support horizontal scaling to 1,000 concurrent users post-launch.

**Reliability & security constraints:**

- 99.5% uptime SLA. OpenAI API errors must be caught and surfaced with a human-readable message and retry option — no silent failures.
- PDFs optionally stored in Supabase Storage with signed URLs (expiry: 1 hour). Storage upload is non-blocking — failure only hides the PDF viewer; the AI pipeline continues using stored text.
- All data encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). Supabase RLS enforced on all tables.

**Usability & compliance constraints:**

- Usable by a non-lawyer with no onboarding training; all legal jargon tooltipped or explained in plain English. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- Data retention: uploaded PDFs stored for 90 days post last-access, then auto-deleted. Users can manually delete a contract and all associated data at any time.
- GDPR-ready: user data deletion on request; DPA available; no contract content used to train third-party models; OpenAI API configured with `user` parameter and no training opt-in.

## 6. Technical Requirements

### Architecture Overview

The system is built as a single-tenant web application with a React frontend, a lightweight serverless backend (Supabase Edge Functions or a hosted Node.js API), and Supabase as the single backend-as-a-service platform for auth, database, and file storage.

**Component layers:**

- **Frontend (React SPA):** Handles all user interactions — auth, upload, PDF rendering, key-term panel, chat interface, dashboard. Communicates with Supabase directly for auth and data reads; calls the backend API for OpenAI-heavy operations.
- **Backend API (Node.js / Supabase Edge Functions):** Orchestrates PDF text extraction, OpenAI prompt calls, structured output parsing, and writes results to Supabase. This layer is kept thin — no business logic lives here beyond orchestration.
- **OpenAI API (GPT-4o):** Handles key term extraction (structured JSON output), confidence scoring, and chat Q&A. Called exclusively from the backend — the OpenAI API key is never exposed to the client.
- **Supabase (single project):** Provides Auth, PostgreSQL database (all tables below), Storage (PDF files), and Realtime subscriptions (for chat message streaming).
- **PDF.js:** Client-side PDF rendering library; renders the uploaded PDF inline in the browser using the signed URL returned by Supabase Storage.

### Database & Storage Setup Requirements

> **Engineering rule:** The generated `database.sql` must be a single paste-and-run file that sets up the entire backend from zero — tables, triggers, indexes, RLS, Storage bucket, and Storage policies. **Nothing requires a dashboard click.** The engineering doc and implementation specs must reproduce every SQL block below verbatim.

#### Required SQL blocks (must all appear in `database.sql`)

**Block 0 — shared trigger function** (runs before any table)
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN NEW.updated_at = now(); RETURN NEW; END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Block 1–6 — application tables** (in dependency order)
Each table must follow this pattern:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {table} ( … );
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_{table}_{col} ON {table} ({col});
ALTER TABLE {table} ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY {table}_{action}_own ON {table} FOR {action} USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
Tables in order: `contracts` → `key_terms` → `term_corrections` → `chat_sessions` → `chat_messages` → `user_feedback`

**Block 7 — Supabase Storage bucket** (must be SQL, NOT a dashboard step)
```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES ('contracts', 'contracts', false, 10485760, ARRAY['application/pdf'])
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

**Block 8 — Storage RLS policies** (must be SQL, NOT a dashboard step)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "storage_insert_own_contracts"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'contracts' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "storage_select_own_contracts"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'contracts' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "storage_delete_own_contracts"
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'contracts' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

**Block 9 — migration pattern** (for any column added after initial schema)
```sql
ALTER TABLE {table} ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS {column} {type};
```
Place migration blocks **at the top** of `database.sql`, before the `CREATE TABLE` statements.

#### Storage rules
- File path pattern: `contracts/{user_id}/{contract_id}/{filename}.pdf`
- Storage upload is **non-blocking**: if it fails, only the PDF viewer is hidden; the AI pipeline (extraction + chat) uses `contract_text` from the DB and is unaffected
- Signed URL expiry: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- PDF viewer has a **text viewer fallback**: when `signed_pdf_url` is null but `contract_text` exists, render the stored text with `[PAGE N]` section markers and font-size controls

#### Key `contracts` table columns
| Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `contract_text` | `text` | Full extracted PDF text with `[PAGE N]` markers; set at upload; read by processing and chat routes |
| `status` | `text` | `pending \| processing \| completed \| error` — drives the results page polling loop |
| `file_path` | `text` | Supabase Storage path; nullable; only needed for the PDF viewer signed URL |
| `error_message` | `text` | Populated when `status = 'error'`; shown on the results page with a retry button |

#### database.sql completeness checklist
The engineering doc must verify the generated file covers all of these before marking schema work done:
- [ ] `update_updated_at()` trigger function
- [ ] `contracts` table + indexes + RLS + `updated_at` trigger
- [ ] `key_terms` table + indexes + RLS
- [ ] `term_corrections` table + indexes + RLS (INSERT only for users; SELECT for service role only)
- [ ] `chat_sessions` table + UNIQUE (contract_id) + indexes + RLS + `updated_at` trigger
- [ ] `chat_messages` table + composite index on `(session_id, created_at)` + RLS
- [ ] `user_feedback` table + UNIQUE (user_id, contract_id) + index + RLS
- [ ] `INSERT INTO storage.buckets` — bucket `contracts`, private, 10 MB limit, PDF only
- [ ] `CREATE POLICY storage_insert_own_contracts ON storage.objects`
- [ ] `CREATE POLICY storage_select_own_contracts ON storage.objects`
- [ ] `CREATE POLICY storage_delete_own_contracts ON storage.objects`
- [ ] Migration block for `contract_text` column (`ALTER TABLE contracts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`)

### Model Requirements

| Criteria | Requirement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Model | GPT-4o via OpenAI API | Best-in-class reasoning on long legal text; JSON mode support for structured output |
| Context window | ≥ 128k tokens | A 20-page contract ≈ 10,000–15,000 tokens; headroom needed for prompt + history |
| Response format | JSON mode enabled (`response_format: { type: "json_object" }`) | Eliminates unparseable free-text responses |
| Max tokens per call | 2,000 output tokens for extraction; 1,000 for chat | Extraction output is bounded; chat answers should be concise |
| Temperature | 0.1 for extraction; 0.4 for chat | Low temperature = deterministic structured extraction; slight warmth for natural chat responses |
| Latency | ≤ 20 seconds per OpenAI call P95 | Combined with UI/UX loader, total experience target is ≤ 30 seconds |
| Cost per analysis | ≤ $0.20 per 20-page contract (extraction only) | At GPT-4o pricing of $0.005/1k input + $0.015/1k output: ~15,000 input tokens + 1,500 output tokens ≈ $0.097 per analysis |

### Model Selection & Cost Trade-offs

| Item | What we use | Why | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| LLM for inference | GPT-4o (OpenAI API) | Best performance on legal text understanding; JSON mode; 128k context | Higher cost than GPT-3.5 or Claude Haiku; API dependency |
| PDF text extraction | pdf-parse (Node.js) / PDF.js | Open-source, no data egress to third parties, handles most text-layer PDFs | Does not handle scanned/image PDFs (out of scope for MVP) |
| Auth & DB | Supabase | Managed Postgres + Auth + Storage in one platform; generous free tier; RLS support | Vendor lock-in; limited to Postgres dialect |
| Frontend | React + Tailwind CSS | Team velocity; large ecosystem; PDF.js compatibility | Requires client-side state management for real-time chat |
| File storage | Supabase Storage | Co-located with DB; signed URLs (1-hour expiry); no extra vendor | Bucket (`contracts`) and RLS policies must be created via SQL before first upload — use `INSERT INTO storage.buckets` and `CREATE POLICY ON storage.objects`; file path: `contracts/{user_id}/{contract_id}/{filename}.pdf`; Storage upload is non-blocking (failure only hides PDF viewer) |
| PDF rendering | PDF.js (client-side) | No server load for rendering; handles page navigation and zoom | Heavy initial load for large PDFs; workaround: lazy-load pages |
| Hosting | Vercel (frontend) + Supabase Edge Functions (backend) | Zero-config deployments; scales automatically | Cold start latency on Edge Functions (~300ms first call); acceptable given 30s extraction budget |

---

## 7. Grounding Strategy

ContractIQ's core trust guarantee is that every AI output is **grounded in the uploaded contract text**, never in the model's general legal knowledge.

- **Single source of truth:** PDF text is extracted **once at upload** with `[PAGE N]` markers and stored in `contracts.contract_text`. Both the extraction pipeline and the chat route read from this stored text — the model never sees anything except the user's own document.
- **Extraction grounding:** Every extracted term carries a `source_sentence` — the verbatim sentence from the contract that the value was drawn from — plus a 1-indexed `page_number`. This makes each output traceable back to the exact location in the document (surfaced via the expandable "Why?" section).
- **Chat grounding (RAG-style):** The chat route passes the **full contract text** as context alongside conversation history. The system prompt instructs: *"Answer only from the document text provided. If the answer is not in the document, say so."* Every chat response must include a mandatory `[Page X]` citation.
- **Full-context strategy:** For contracts ≤ 15,000 tokens, the entire document is passed on every turn (no chunking / vector retrieval needed at MVP). This guarantees no relevant clause is missed due to retrieval error. A chunked RAG strategy is deferred until contract length limits are raised post-v1.0.
- **Conversation memory:** The full conversation history (up to 200 messages, ascending) is passed on every turn, enabling memory-style questions ("what did you say earlier about X?"). A query-classification layer (`contract` / `history` / `both`) adjusts the system prompt and context inclusion without an extra API call.
- **"Not found" as a valid answer:** When information is absent from the document, "I cannot find this in the document" is the correct, expected response — not a failure.

---

## 8. Prompt Strategy

| Task | Technique | Output Format | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Key term extraction | Few-shot (3 labelled NDA examples, 3 MSA examples in system prompt) | JSON array: `[{ "term_name": string, "value": string, "page_number": int, "confidence_score": float, "source_sentence": string }]` | Consistent structured output across clause variant diversity; few-shot examples ground the model on the expected schema |
| Confidence scoring | Embedded in extraction prompt — model self-reports a 0.0–1.0 score alongside each term | Float field within the JSON term object | Avoids a second inference call; model reasons about its own certainty while extracting |
| Custom term extraction | Zero-shot with term name injected into the extraction prompt as an additional target | Same JSON schema as standard terms | Custom terms are appended to the standard term list passed to the model |
| Contract chat (Q&A) | Retrieval-Augmented: full contract text passed as context + conversation history (last 10 turns); system prompt: "Answer only from the document text provided. If the answer is not in the document, say so." | Free text with a mandatory page citation tag: `[Page X]` | Grounds responses strictly in the uploaded document; prevents hallucination from general legal knowledge |
| Error recovery | If JSON parse fails, a retry prompt is sent: "Your previous response was not valid JSON. Return only the JSON array, no explanation." | JSON array | Single automatic retry before surfacing an error to the user |

**Prompt improvement plan:**
- Maintain a versioned prompt library (v1.0, v1.1…) in a shared document accessible to the product team
- A/B test extraction prompts monthly on a 50-contract offline eval set
- Log every user edit to a `term_corrections` view; trigger a prompt review if correction rate exceeds 12% of terms in any 7-day window

---

## 9. Hallucination Guardrails

ContractIQ treats hallucination — the model asserting something not in the contract — as the top trust risk. Layered guardrails address it at extraction, chat, and UI level.

**Extraction-layer guardrails:**
- **Confidence scoring on every term:** The model self-reports a 0–100% confidence per extracted term. Scores are colour-coded (green ≥ 80%, amber 50–79%, red < 50%).
- **Low-confidence flagging:** Terms with confidence < 50% show a ⚠️ warning and a non-dismissible tooltip: *"Low confidence — we recommend verifying this in the document directly."* The term is **never hidden** — it is shown with the warning so the user retains control.
- **Source-sentence requirement:** Every term must carry the verbatim `source_sentence` it was drawn from; a term with no supporting sentence is treated as unreliable.
- **Deterministic settings:** Extraction runs at temperature 0.1 with JSON mode enforced to minimise fabrication and unparseable output.
- **Calibration monitoring:** Monthly calibration evaluation checks that predicted confidence matches observed accuracy; a UI calibration warning is shown if eval reveals ≥ 15% miscalibration.

**Chat-layer guardrails:**
- **Document-only system prompt:** The model is instructed to answer strictly from the provided contract text and to reply "I cannot find this in the document" when the answer is absent.
- **Mandatory page citation:** Every chat response must include a `[Page X]` citation, making claims verifiable against the source.
- **"Based on the document…" framing:** Responses are prefixed to remind users the answer is scoped to their contract, mitigating model overconfidence on unfamiliar contract types.
- **Automated hallucination test:** A regression test feeds a question about a topic not present in the document and asserts the model responds "I cannot find this."

**UI / human-in-the-loop guardrails:**
- **Inline correction:** Users can edit any extracted term; the original AI value is stored separately to feed the improvement loop.
- **PDF auto-highlight:** Low-confidence terms auto-highlight the nearest matching page span so the user can verify in one click.
- **"Not legal advice" disclaimer:** Present on every results page — *"This is an AI-assisted review tool, not legal advice. Always verify critical terms with a qualified lawyer."*

## 10. Evaluation Strategy

### Ground truth sources

- CUAD (Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset) — 13,000+ annotations across 510 commercial contracts; used for offline baseline evaluation
- 30 manually labelled NDA contracts (internal, annotated by a legal SME before beta)
- 20 manually labelled MSA contracts (internal, annotated by a legal SME before beta)
- User-corrected terms (opt-in, anonymised) — fed into ongoing prompt improvement

### Evaluation Plan

| Eval Type | Method | Target | Cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Key term extraction accuracy | Precision / Recall / F1 against manually labelled test set (30 NDA + 20 MSA) | ≥ 88% F1 (NDA); ≥ 85% F1 (MSA) | Every release |
| Confidence score calibration | Calibration curve: predicted confidence vs. actual accuracy bucketed by 10% intervals | Calibration error ≤ 0.10 (each bucket's predicted confidence within 10% of observed accuracy) | Monthly |
| Page number accuracy | % of terms where returned page_number matches ground truth page | ≥ 92% correct page attribution | Every release |
| Custom term extraction accuracy | F1 on a set of 10 predefined custom terms injected into 15 test contracts | ≥ 80% F1 | Every release |
| Chat groundedness | Expert review: 50 Q&A pairs from real contracts; score each response as Grounded (from doc) / Hallucinated (from general knowledge) / Not found (correct) | ≤ 5% hallucinated responses | Monthly |
| End-to-end latency | P95 timing from upload submission to results panel rendered | ≤ 30 seconds | Every release |
| User satisfaction (beta) | Post-review survey: "Were the extracted terms accurate?" (Yes / Partially / No) | ≥ 75% "Yes" in beta | Beta phase |

### AI Performance Monitoring (Post-Launch)
- Automated regression suite runs on every deploy using the 50-contract labelled test set
- Weekly drift check: sample 10 recent user-corrected terms and compare against expected extraction
- Alert: if correction rate exceeds 12% in any 7-day rolling window, trigger an immediate prompt review
- Monthly: legal SME audits 5 random contracts from production output for quality assurance

### Evaluation Spreadsheet

## 11. Production Readiness Criteria & Metrics (HHH)

### HHH Evaluation

| Pillar | Strength | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Helpful** | Reduces NDA/MSA review from 90 minutes to ≤ 15 minutes; surfaces terms non-lawyers routinely miss; custom terms accommodate specific business needs | Output could overwhelm users with too many terms; low-confidence terms might be acted on without verification | Prioritise the 10–12 most material terms by default; confidence warnings are prominent and non-dismissible |
| **Honest** | All extracted values show the verbatim source sentence; confidence score is always displayed; "I cannot find this in the document" is a valid chat response | Confidence scores may be miscalibrated early; model may over-report confidence | Monthly calibration evaluation; show calibration warning in UI if eval shows ≥ 15% miscalibration; disclaimer: "ContractIQ is not legal advice" on every results page |
| **Harmless** | Domain is factual contract text; no toxic or harmful content generated; user corrections prevent erroneous terms from persisting | User acts on an incorrect extraction and signs a contract with unfavourable terms | Prominent disclaimer on every results page: "This is an AI-assisted review tool, not legal advice. Always verify critical terms with a qualified lawyer."; confidence warnings for any term < 50% |

### Launch Criteria

| Stage | Helpful | Honest | Harmless | Go Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Internal Alpha (team only) | Basic extraction working | Source sentences shown | Disclaimer present | Core upload-extract-display flow works end-to-end without crashes |
| Measurement Beta (≤ 50 users) | ≥ 75% user satisfaction in post-review survey | Correction rate ≤ 20% | 0 incidents of misleading output without confidence warning | No P0 bugs; latency ≤ 45s P95; F1 ≥ 82% on eval set |
| Public Launch | ≥ 80% user satisfaction | Correction rate ≤ 12%; calibration error ≤ 0.10 | Security audit passed; RLS verified; legal disclaimer approved | F1 ≥ 88% NDA / 85% MSA; latency ≤ 30s P95; Supabase Pro provisioned; DPA with OpenAI confirmed |

### Responsible AI

**Accountability:**

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Efficacy & limitations of the product | ContractIQ accurately extracts standard NDA and MSA terms from English-language, text-layer PDFs at ≥ 88% F1. It does not provide legal advice, does not handle scanned PDFs, does not support non-English contracts, and may miss highly unusual or bespoke clauses not present in standard NDA/MSA structures |
| Compliance policies for sensitive data | Contracts contain commercially sensitive and potentially personal data. All files are stored encrypted at rest in Supabase Storage (AES-256); transferred over TLS 1.3; accessible only via time-limited signed URLs. GDPR Article 28 DPA required with Supabase and OpenAI before EU user onboarding |
| How is sensitive data managed | Uploaded PDFs are stored in Supabase Storage for 90 days and then auto-deleted. The plain-text content extracted from the PDF is stored in `contracts.contract_text` in the database (encrypted at rest) so the AI pipeline does not need to re-download the file on every request. Only the text content and structured key term output are persisted — no model training occurs on this data. Users can delete their contracts and all associated data at any time from their dashboard |
| Human oversight and control | Confidence scores and source sentences are always shown, enabling human verification. Users can correct any extracted term. A legal disclaimer is present on every results page. Chat responses cite page numbers for traceability. No irreversible action is taken by the AI |

**Transparency:**

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Direct and indirect use cases | Direct: SMBs and freelancers reviewing NDA/MSA contracts before signing. Indirect (potential misuse): extracting competitive intelligence from contracts shared without authorisation. Mitigation: terms of service prohibit use of third-party confidential contracts without permission |
| How are results generated | PDF → text extraction (pdf-parse) → structured prompt to GPT-4o (OpenAI API) → JSON output parsed and stored → displayed in key terms panel. No training of any model on user data |
| Benchmarks shared with users | Accuracy benchmarks (F1 on NDA/MSA test sets) and confidence calibration results will be published on a public trust page once post-launch eval is complete |
| Disclosures required | "Not legal advice" disclaimer on every results page; confidence scores visible per term; source sentence expandable per term; "Powered by OpenAI GPT-4o" attribution in footer |

**Fairness:**

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Which groups are underrepresented | Non-US/non-UK contract conventions; contracts from South Asian, African, or Latin American jurisdictions; highly specialised industries with non-standard clause structures (healthcare, defence) |
| Why they don't work well and the plan | Training data (CUAD) is heavily weighted toward US commercial contracts. Prompt few-shot examples are US/UK-biased. Plan: after launch, collect opt-in anonymised data from non-US users; add non-US few-shot examples in v1.2; evaluate by jurisdiction in monthly audit |
| Test/feedback loop to identify gaps | Monthly accuracy audit segmented by contract jurisdiction (where available) and industry; user feedback tagged with contract type helps surface systematic gaps |

**Reliability & Safety:**

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Acceptable error rates | ≤ 12% of terms corrected by users in production; ≤ 5% hallucinated chat responses; 0% critical failures (data exposed to wrong user) |
| Consequences of bad input | Corrupted PDF → graceful error message, no partial output stored. Non-contract document (e.g. invoice) → AI extracts what it can, confidence scores will be low, user sees ⚠️ warnings on most terms |
| Recovery plan if system fails | OpenAI API failure: 3-retry with backoff, then surface error to user with "Try again" CTA; contract status set to `'error'` in DB so user can retry without re-uploading. Supabase downtime: frontend shows maintenance banner; no data loss risk as all writes are transactional |
| How is system health monitored | Vercel deployment logs; Supabase dashboard for DB and storage metrics; OpenAI usage dashboard for token consumption and error rates; Uptime Robot for endpoint monitoring with alerts to team Slack |
| Customer communication plan | P0 incident (data exposure, complete outage): in-app banner + email to all affected users within 1 hour; status page updated within 30 minutes. P1 incident (degraded performance): in-app banner within 2 hours |

## 13. Assumptions

The following assumptions were made to produce a complete PRD. Each is a risk item that should be validated before the corresponding phase begins:

1. **OpenAI GPT-4o achieves ≥ 82% F1** on NDA and MSA key term extraction with few-shot prompting, without fine-tuning. This is the most critical assumption — if false, a fine-tuned model or alternative LLM (Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro) must be evaluated before v0.2 ships.
2. **Target users are English-speaking** and review contracts governed by US or UK law. International contract conventions are out of scope for the initial 12 months.
3. **Uploaded contracts are text-layer PDFs**, not scanned images. Scanned PDFs will receive a graceful error message. OCR support is planned for v1.2.
4. **Supabase free tier is sufficient for development and early alpha testing** (< 200 contracts stored). The Pro plan at $25/month is assumed for beta and production.
5. **Contract length is ≤ 20 pages / ≤ 15,000 tokens** for MVP. Contracts longer than this will be rejected with a clear error message and a note that longer contract support is coming.
6. **The team has access to a legal SME** who can annotate 50 ground-truth contracts for the evaluation set before beta launch. If no SME is available, the CUAD dataset will be used as the sole ground truth, reducing eval confidence.
7. **MVP build team consists of 2–3 engineers and 1 PM**, working full-time for 14 weeks. Timeline estimates assume this capacity.
8. **OpenAI pricing remains within ±30% of current rates** ($0.005/1k input, $0.015/1k output for GPT-4o) over the first 12 months post-launch.
9. **Supabase Row Level Security correctly isolates user data** without a custom auth middleware layer. This assumption is validated by Supabase's documented RLS capability — it must be verified by a security review before launch.
10. **Users are comfortable with browser-based PDF viewing** and do not require a native desktop application for PDF review workflows.
11. **Chat uses full contract text as context in every turn**, not a chunked RAG approach. This works for contracts ≤ 15,000 tokens but will require a chunking strategy if contract length limits are increased post-v1.0.
12. **Pricing model and tiers are directional only** — final pricing will be validated through user interviews and a pricing sensitivity survey during the beta phase.
13. **The Supabase Storage bucket and its RLS policies are created via SQL**, not via the Supabase dashboard. The `database.sql` file must include `INSERT INTO storage.buckets` and three `CREATE POLICY ON storage.objects` statements (INSERT, SELECT, DELETE). If these are omitted from the SQL file, PDF uploads will silently fail — the upload route will catch the storage error, leave `file_path = null`, and the PDF viewer will not render. The text viewer fallback will still work because `contract_text` is stored independently in the DB.
14. **The full conversation history is passed to the chat model on every turn**, not just the last 10 messages. The chat route fetches all messages for the session (up to 200) in ascending order and passes them as the message array. This enables memory-style questions ("what did you say earlier about X?"). The query classification layer (`contract` / `history` / `both`) adjusts the system prompt and context inclusion without an extra API call.
